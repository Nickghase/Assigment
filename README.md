Language used : Python 

1) House Price Prediction:
Data processing: 1)features which are correlated with each other are removed,that is data without
Multicolinearity
2) Data normalisation using MinMaxScaler 
3) Eda to understand features relationship with houses price.
Model used : 
Linear regression
Decision tree regressor
SVR
KNeighbors regressor
Ensemble techniques: random forest regressor and XGBoost regressor.

Understanding features which are responsible for predicting house prices and 
predicting house price using different regressor models in which XGB regressor gives high score.

 Task 2 Product_matching:

1) Creating word embedding using pretrained model sentence transformer 
2) Using cosine similarity to find distance between embedded vector of one data with another data
To see the highest similarity between two products.
3) Top 1 similarity product has chosen.

library used : pytorch and transformer
output file is named as result which has matched products from both dataset.
